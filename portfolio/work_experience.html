						<p>Currently, I am designing an application for the Art Cart program at the University of Michigan Hospital intended to enhance patient-program interaction. My team and I are currently researching common objectives among potential users to ensure the functions of the application meet the requirements of the targeted audience. After our research, we will begin creating wireframes and prototypes to prepare the application for user testing prior to developer analysis. As well, I will be leading user testing and client meetings to guarantee that the design of the application is accessible for all parties.</p>

						<p>In both the summers of 2017 and 2019 I was able to gain internship experience at TSM Corporation, a Tier 1 automotive supplier. In the summer of 2019 I was able to focus specifically on my field as an IT intern. This allowed me to operated cohesively with the internal ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software and share company drive documents to enhance office system performance. With the constant change in requirements throughout the industry, I was given the opportunity to redesign labels for outgoing products to meet new manufacturer standards. Lastly, I was responsible for generating custom reports, using the SQL server within the existing ERP software, to improve managersâ€™ ability to locate relevant statistics.</p>
